# FinalYearProj
Repositry of code for final year TP project.
simfiles should contain all (probably too many) of the files used to run the simulation.
pyscript.py and the four .inp files were used to create the dataset, along with the split trajectory files.
The .ipynb file has examples of how the data is prepared, the network training and loading and using the network.
singlemodel contains the network for single rdf inputs.
finalfinalmodel contains the network for 3 rdf inputs.
